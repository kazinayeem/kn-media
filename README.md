This is a full-stack social media application that allows users to create accounts, follow others, post content, interact with posts (like, comment), and receive real-time notifications about activities. The project is built to give hands-on experience with key web development technologies, including user authentication, databases, real-time data handling, and creating scalable front-end solutions using React.
